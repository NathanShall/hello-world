# hello-world
My first foray into GitHub!

This is a part of my transition into the field of data analytics. For now, I intend to use GitHub to store the SQL and Excel code that I learn along the way. Perhaps in the future it will include Python and other coding tools as well. 
I love data, and am passionate about all aspects of its collection, processing, analysis, and visualization. Things just work better when you have data to inform the path you decide to take.
Looking forward to all that's in store!
